# What is Docker?
Docker is a framework that allows executions of applications in the same environment regardless of underlying operating systems and system libraries.
# Docker image vs container
A docker image is a blueprint for a container. Executing an image results in setting up a container. As an analogy, a docker image is like a java class and a container is an object.
# Docker hub
Docker hub allows us to get docker images for various purposes. Eg: Image to spin up a ElasticSearch (es) cluster.
# Container state
Recreating containers results in loss of state. For example, if we have an ES container, and index some documents into it, but we restart it, these documents will be lost. In order to persist
state across container restarts, we have to mount a volume to our containers by using the `-v` parameter
# Docker compose
There might be various images that need to be run in different orders in order to get a application up and running. Docker compose allows us to do this.
